Flood Hazard 10 Years - Existing climate;https://hazards-data.unepgrid.ch/global_pc_h10glob.tif;The hydrological model used is the Continuum model (Silvestro et al. 2013 and 2015). It is a continuous, distributed and physically based hydrological model able to reproduce the spatial-temporal evolution of soil moisture, energy fluxes, surface soil temperature, evapotranspiration and discharge. Climate dataset used for the simulation of basin response are the W5E5 Global Meteorological dataset for present climate, and the ISIMIP3b Global Meteorological reanalysis dataset for the futur climate. In order to generate flood hazard maps, resulting discharge estimates are input to an hydraulic model based on the Manning equation that compute channel uniform flow depth. This simplified approach fits to determine flood maps on large areas. ;Detailed methodology available in the GIRI background papers: The GIRI global flood hazard model https://giri.unepgrid.ch/sites/default/files/2023-09/CIMA_GIRI_Flood_BGpaper.pdf.

Susceptibility Class of Landslides Triggered By Earthquakes;https://hazards-data.unepgrid.ch/n1_mosaic_wgs84_opt.tif;"The earthquake-induced landslides susceptibility map indicates the areas of the world that are more prone to landslides triggered by earthquakes. The landslide susceptibility is based on the model developed by NGI (Nadim et al., 2006, 2013; Jaedicke et al., 2013) but with improvements and refinements. The earthquake-induced landslides susceptibility map classifies the terrain into five susceptibility classes by combining slope, vegetation, lithology, and soil moisture information from global datasets. The weights of different susceptibility factors were calibrated to the information available in landslide inventories and physical processes. The susceptibility map has global coverage and a resolution of 3 arc-sec. (~90 meters at the equator). The data is available as 5-degree x 5-degree tiles (6000 pixels x 6000 pixels), compressed into 30-degree x 30-degree packages.";A new model for global landslide susceptibility assessment and scenario-based hazard assessment (2003) Rosa M.

The precipitation-induced landslides susceptibility map for the current climate classifies the terrain into five susceptibility classes by combining slope, vegetation, lithology, and antecedent rainfall information from global datasets. Antecedent rainfall information has been obtained from the W5E5 dataset for the period 1979-2016.
