 The Global Building Exposure Model, or simply BEM provides essential data for understanding the potential impact of hazards on the built environment. 
 
 An exposure model that includes a global inventory of the building stock based on a purely bottom-up approach would require considerable human and economic effort and is beyond the scope of this project. 
  
 In the absence of a bottom-up approach, a spatial disaggregation was used. This consists of a top-down or downscaling approach, where information including socio-economic, building type and capital stock at national or sub-national level (statistical data) is transferred to a regular grid, using GIS data such as geographic population and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) distribution models as proxies.";The GIRI global building exposure model (BEM) (2023).
